I have been working in data engineering since beginning of 2019, both in-house,
as a consultant, and now as a freelancer. I am specializing in cloud based data
engineering and have experience from building data platforms with several
different technologies, including Databricks, Snowflake and the Azure Ecosystem.
I write fluent Python and SQL, and also have extensive experience from setting
up and managing cloud environments using Terraform. If you are currently in need
of an experienced data professional, lets [connect and have a chat!](/contact).

Before working as a freelancer, I worked as a consultant at Innofactor from
October 2021 to April 2024, where I helped different customers implement data
platforms. My work was heavily focused on cloud-based lakehouse architectures,
but I also worked on more traditional Data Warehouse projects where we used Data
Vault 2.0.

I have also worked as an in-house Data Engineer at a Finnish oil refining
company named Neste, where I participated in a  project setting up a new
cloud-based data platform. I also had the opportunity to work on more end-user
focused activities including business process analysis and process mining.

Before working in analytics, I worked for a year as a Business Analyst at
Accenture and I also did a 6-month internship in Germany at the European Central
Bank, where I worked in their IT department with various tasks related to
Service Catalog Management.

I got interested in analytics during my time at university in the early 2010s,
while learning about the huge potentials of machine learning and analytics. This
    was also during the initial "Big Data" hype and really before the term "Data
    Engineering" had been coined. Data Engineering has come a long way since the
    early 2010s and the overall landscape of tools, processes and best practices
    has evolved rapidly. Even though _The Modern Data Stackâ„¢_ seems to be over,
    I am optimistic of the future of Data Engineering as companies can (and are
    forced to) focus more and more on value creation.
