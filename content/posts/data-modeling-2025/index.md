Data modeling is an old subfield of Data Engineering that is actually older than
the term Data Engineering itself. However, it is still to this day a quite
debated and slightly controversial field. Controversial, because people tend to
have strong strong opinions regarding which modeling methodology are their
favorites and which ones are their least favorite. One thing I find interesting
about Data Modeling is the lack of modern innovations and approaches. The
relational model was introduced in 1970, and the more data warehouse -focused
methodologies about a decade or two later. After that, very little has happened
in terms of methdology development, while there has happened quite a lot on the
technical side.

The first time I got in touch with data modeling was during university
(Introduction to database systems). This was early 2010s and NoSQL had not made
it's way into the course curriculum yet, hence the course was exclusively
focused on relational databases and the relational model. When thinking about
what skills I use in my daily work, this course was probably the most
important one I took during my years at university. Having a fundamental
understanding of relationships, key constraints and normalization makes it a lot
easier to make informed data modeling decisions. I don't think one can truly
understand facts and dimensions without understanding the concepts of
normalization and constraints.
